# BeatSaverVoting
Voting mod for beat saber quest, allowing users to send in votes to beatsaver from their games on quest.
Now that getting the user proof is possible currently, voting from the quest game works, so this mod allows users to do that.

This mod utilizes beatsaverplusplus and webutils to send requests to the beatsaver api to then allow the user to vote. This is pretty much just a direct port of BeatSaverVoting for PC, except zenject is utilized and the level is accessed differently.
